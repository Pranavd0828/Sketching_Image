This project involves two key technological processes: the first converts input images into hand-drawn sketches, while the second uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to transform these sketches back into realistic images. This dual approach showcases advanced applications of deep learning, where the initial phase emphasizes feature extraction and pattern recognition to create sketch-like outputs, and the second phase leverages the adversarial training of GANs to fill in details, textures, and colors, turning simple sketches into lifelike images.
